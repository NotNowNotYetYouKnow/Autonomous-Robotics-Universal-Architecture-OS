## Getting Started (Sketch v0.0.1)

### Prerequisites
- Rust Toolchain: Ensure you have the Rust toolchain installed. You can install it from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).

### Project Structure
The AuraOS sketch is organized as a Rust workspace:
```toml
[workspace]
members = [
    "aura_core",
    "aura_examples",
]

resolver = "2" # Use the new feature resolver

[workspace.dependencies]
# Common dependencies could go here if needed by multiple crates
# e.g., serde for serialization, tokio for async (though we'll keep it sync for simplicity here)
```

### Building and Running Examples
1. **Navigate to the Root Directory:** Open a terminal and navigate to the `aura_os` directory.
2. **Build the Project:** Run `cargo build` to compile the project.
3. **Run Examples:** Execute `cargo run --example <example_name>` to run specific examples.

## Core Concepts in AuraOS (Sketch v0.0.1)

### Initialization and Shutdown
Every AuraOS application must initialize the framework:
```rust
// In your main function
fn main() -> aura_core::Result<()> {
    aura_core::init(); // Initialize AuraOS
    ...
}
```

### Nodes (`aura_core::node::Node`)
Nodes are the fundamental processing units in AuraOS, responsible for executing tasks and communicating with other nodes:
```rust
use aura_core::node::Node;
// Node implementation details...
```

### Communication
AuraOS employs a robust communication framework to facilitate interaction between nodes, ensuring efficient data exchange and synchronization.

### Parameters
AuraOS supports a dynamic parameter management system, allowing for runtime configuration and introspection of node parameters.

### Error Handling
AuraOS incorporates comprehensive error handling mechanisms to ensure robustness and reliability in robotic applications.
