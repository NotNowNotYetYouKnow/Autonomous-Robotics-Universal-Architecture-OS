## Vision

AuraOS is a next-generation, open-source robotics application framework and development ecosystem, engineered from the ground up to empower the creation of sophisticated, reliable, and intelligent autonomous robots. It aims to provide an unparalleled developer experience, blending high performance and safety with intuitive tools and a cohesive, extensible architecture.

## Core Philosophy

*   **Developer-Centricity:** Prioritizing ease of use, rapid iteration, clear abstractions, comprehensive documentation, and powerful debugging tools to reduce friction and accelerate innovation.
*   **Performance & Safety by Design:** Leveraging modern systems programming languages like Rust for core components to ensure memory safety, concurrency safety, and high performance for critical robotics tasks.
*   **Unified & Cohesive Ecosystem:** While modular and extensible, all core components (communication, simulation, tooling, device interaction) are designed to work together seamlessly, offering a consistent and integrated development environment.
*   **Hardware Agnostic, Hardware Aware:** Designed to run on diverse hardware platforms – from resource-constrained microcontrollers to powerful multi-core SoCs and cloud servers – while providing mechanisms (via AuraHAL) to optimize for specific architectures and leverage hardware accelerators.
*   **Simulation as a First-Class Citizen:** Featuring AuraSim, a deeply integrated, high-fidelity, and performant simulator that accelerates development, testing, and validation, enabling seamless sim-to-real workflows.
*   **Data-Driven & Intelligent:** Built to facilitate efficient data collection, processing, logging, and utilization, with rich introspection capabilities and built-in diagnostics to help users understand and manage their robotic systems.

## Key Architectural Pillars & Features (Overview)

- **I. AuraCore (The Foundation - Primarily Rust):** Provides essential runtime services and libraries.
- **II. AuraSim (Next-Generation Simulator):** A deeply integrated simulation environment designed for realism, performance, and ease of use.
- **III. AuraDev (Developer Tools & Ecosystem):** A comprehensive suite of tools designed to maximize developer productivity and streamline the robotics development lifecycle.
- **IV. AuraDevice (Sensor & Actuator Interaction):** Standardized and efficient mechanisms for interacting with the physical world.
- **V. AuraAI, Perception, Navigation & Motion Stacks:** High-quality, official AuraOS packages and libraries providing foundational robotics capabilities.
- **VI. AuraSafety & Security:** Built-in considerations for building dependable and secure robotic systems.

For a more detailed breakdown of the architecture, please see [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md).

## Getting Started (Sketch v0.0.1)

### Prerequisites
- **Rust Toolchain:** Ensure you have the Rust toolchain installed. You can install it from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).

### Project Structure
The AuraOS sketch is organized as a Rust workspace:
```
aura_os/
├── Cargo.toml                     # Workspace root
├── aura_core/                     # Core library crate
│   ├── Cargo.toml
│   └── src/                       # Source code for aura_core
│       ├── lib.rs                 # Main library file
│       ├── error.rs               # Error types
│       ├── node.rs                # Node definition
│       ├── param/                 # Parameter management
│       │   └── mod.rs
│       └── comm/                  # Communication
│           ├── mod.rs
│           ├── publisher.rs
│           └── subscriber.rs
└── aura_examples/                 # Example applications
    ├── Cargo.toml
    └── src/
        ├── talker.rs              # Talker example binary
        └── listener.rs            # Listener example binary
```

### Building and Running Examples
1. **Navigate to the Root Directory:** Open a terminal and change to the `aura_os/` directory.
2. **Build the Project:** Run `cargo build` to compile both `aura_core` and the example binaries.
3. **Run the Examples:**
   - **In Terminal 1 (Listener):** `cargo run --bin aura_listener_example`
   - **In Terminal 2 (Talker):** `cargo run --bin aura_talker_example`
   - **Stopping the Examples:** Press `CTRL-C` in each terminal to gracefully shut down the nodes.

## Core Concepts in AuraOS (Sketch v0.0.1)

### Initialization and Shutdown
Every AuraOS application must initialize the core environment at the beginning and shut it down gracefully at the end.

```rust
// In your main function
fn main() -> aura_core::Result<()> {
    aura_core::init(); // Initialize AuraOS

    // ... your application logic ...

    aura_core::shutdown(); // Shutdown AuraOS
    Ok(())
}
```

### Nodes (`aura_core::node::Node`)
Nodes are the fundamental processing units in AuraOS. Each node typically performs a specific task (e.g., sensor driver, planner, controller).

```rust
use aura_core::node::Node;

// Create a Node
let my_node = Node::new("my_node", "/ns")?;
```

### Communication (`aura_core::comm`)
Nodes communicate primarily through a publish-subscribe mechanism on **topics**.

* **Publishers (`aura_core::comm::Publisher`):**
```rust
let publisher = my_node.create_publisher("topic_name")?;
publisher.publish("message".to_string())?;
```

* **Subscribers (`aura_core::comm::Subscriber`):**
```rust
let subscriber = my_node.create_subscriber("topic_name")?;
let message = subscriber.recv_timeout(Duration::from_millis(100))?;
```

### Parameters (`aura_core::param`)
Parameters allow configuring node behavior at runtime without recompiling code.

```rust
let params = my_node.params();
params.declare_parameter("param_name", ParamValue::Float(1.0))?;
let value = params.get_parameter("param_name")?;
```

### Error Handling (`aura_core::error`)
AuraOS uses Rust's `Result` type for error handling. Most AuraOS functions return `aura_core::Result<T>`.

```rust
fn my_function() -> aura_core::Result<()> {
    // ...
    Ok(())
}
```

## Future Directions

This initial sketch lays the groundwork. A complete AuraOS would include:

* Strongly-Typed Messages
* Services & Actions
* Executors & Callback Groups
* Lifecycle Management
* AuraSim Enhancements
* AuraDev Tooling
* Distributed Communication
* Advanced Parameter System
* TF (Transform System)
* Comprehensive Standard Libraries
